                <h2>Question and Answer</h2>
                <h5>When did you start playing music?</h5>
                <p>Answer: I think I picked up an instrument for the first time when I was a teenager. I've been writing music on and off since then.</p>
                <h5>What do you do when you're not making music?</h5>
                <p>By trade I'm a physician, I help run a medical school based in Milwaukee.</p>
                <h5>Do you ever work with other musicians?</h5>
                <p>I was in a few bands during my teenage years, but I've mostly been a solo act since then.</p>
                <h5>What kind of venues do you normally play?</h5>
                <p>Currently, I'm not able to do live shows because of the pandemic. Before 2020, I played different receptions and dinners for different folks as needed.</p>
                <h5>Who are your influences?</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Billy Joel</li>
                    <li>Al Stewart</li>

                    <li>Chicago</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>What instruments do you play?</h5>
                <p>Among family and friends I'm known for playing a guitar, but I also play the banjo and the piano during recording sessions. I also have twelve-string and electric guitars for this purpose.</p>
