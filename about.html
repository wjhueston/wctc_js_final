        <p><div class="paragraphMarginFix">Knitting is my hobby. Living in Wisconsin there's a lot of need for a warm knit hat in the winter time. When I'm not vanquishing cold heads, I moonlight as a Veterinarian. I make about 30 hats a year on average. Some ugly, some weird, but all warm. Knitting makes me feel comfortable. I often find myself knitting for hours without realizing it, and a new hat is born by accident. The idea to give hats away came to me in a dream. My sons and husband already have dozens of hats thrust upon them each winter, so I thought it would be fun to warm someone else's head instead. I usually work on about five at a time regardless of the number of requests in my inbox. I would love to hear from you if you received a hat from me. Let me know how you like it, if it's keeping you warm this winter, and what I could have done to improve the quality. I got my start with knitting when I moved to Wisconsin. I had always been a practiced knitter, but there wasn't much call for warm hats in the deep south. One of my sons asked me for a demonstration when he was looking for a new hobby, and it reignited my passion for knitting. It relaxes me. After a hard day surrounded by barking dogs, there's nothing I like more than to flop down on the couch with my latest project in hand and watch some television. I've never gotten bored of knitting, and I expect I never will. But enough about me, I've got some knitting to do!</div></p>
